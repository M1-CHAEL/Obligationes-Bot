# Obligationes-Bot
A repo of a discord logic game bot

This game follows the 13th-14th century debate format called Obligationes. The computer acts as the Positor who presents the player who is referred to as the Respondent with logical statements that must either be affirmed or denied as being true or not. If the Respondent makes a logical fallacy they loose the game, otherwise it continues ad infinitum. The Respondent's score is determined by how many correct statements they answer in a row without making a mistake.
